ðŸš€ Day 6 Challenge: Start Coding! ðŸš€

Question 16: More Guests: You've found a bigger dinner table, so there's room for more guests.

Explain & TIP: When you have more space, you can add more guests to your list. You can add guests at the beginning, middle, and end of an array.


Question 17: Shrinking Guest List: Unfortunately, your new table wonâ€™t arrive in time, and you can only invite two guests.

Explain & TIP: Sometimes plans change, and you'll need to adjust your guest list. Removing guests from your list is straightforward but should be done thoughtfully.


Question 18: Seeing the World: Think of at least five places youâ€™d like to visit.

Explain & TIP: Arrays can be ordered and reordered in various ways without altering the original list, useful for planning and organizing information.

These exercises give you practical experience with managing lists in dynamic situations and manipulating arrays to organize data effectively.
