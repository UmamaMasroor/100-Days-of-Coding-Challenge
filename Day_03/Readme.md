🚀 Day 3 Challenge: Start Coding! 🚀

Question 7: Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Enclose your operations in print statements.

Explain & TIP: Play with numbers to get 8 using different math operations. It's a fun way to see how you can perform calculations in code.

Question 8: You should create four lines that look like this:
console.log(5 + 3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.


Explain & TIP: Just like before, use basic math operations to display the number 8. This reinforces how to display outputs in coding.


Question 9: Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, create a message revealing your favorite number. Print that message.

Explain & TIP: Use a variable to remember your favorite number. Then, show a message with it. This is a great way to see how variables can hold different types of data, like numbers.

Note:
These exercises introduce you to basic math operations and variables in TypeScript, highlighting the flexibility and utility of coding in everyday scenarios!
