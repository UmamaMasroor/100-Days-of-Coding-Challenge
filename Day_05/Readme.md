🚀 Day 5 Challenge: Start Coding! 🚀

Question 13: Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

Explain & TIP: Arrays help you group related items, like types of transportation. This way, you can talk about each one using a loop.

Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

Explain & TIP: Just like with transportation, you can use an array to manage a list of guests. Loop through the list to send each one a personal invitation.

Question 15: Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.

Explain & TIP: Arrays are flexible. You can replace an item if someone can't make it, then loop through the list again for new invitations.
